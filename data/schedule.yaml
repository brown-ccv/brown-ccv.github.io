    abstract: Physical phenomena such as fluid flow, wave propagation, heat flow, quantum-mechanical system etc. are defined by partial differential equations (PDEs). To simulate these phenomena its essential to solve these  PDEs using numerical discretization. Numerical discretization is very complex and suffers the curse of dimensionality and meshes. Thanks to Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN) for circumventing these problems. In this work, we show the efficiency of data parallel model, implemented over GPUs, to overcome the computational complexity of PINN models.

    abstract: The LUX detector was a dark matter search experiment which operated at the 4850 ft level of the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF). The experiment had a total operation time exceeding 3 years, during which time data was continuous transferred to Brown and processed in real time using the Oscar cluster. In total, LUX collected more than 500 TB of data, all of which was processed and reduced to analysis-ready features on Oscar. This talk will describe the details of the data handling and the strategies used to implement the processing scheme.

    abstract: "We have developed Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations based on guineafowl X-ray Reconstruction of Moving Morphology (XROMM) data and CT scans of Early Jurassic fossil dinosaur tracks. Foot motion data serve as inputs for dynamic DEM substrate simulations made up of millions of particles. To explore the dense volumes of 3D data generated from these methods, we turned to an immersive virtual reality (VR) room, Brown’s Yurt Ultimate Reality Theater (YURT). This talk will highlight the process of developing interactive visualizations that allow us to synthesize substrate flow at the particle, particle cluster, surface, and volumetric scale. "

    abstract: "Phthalate esters (phthalates) are a class of compounds used to plasticize polyvinyl chloride and as components of various industrial and personal care products. Human exposure to phthalates is nearly universal, and phthalates are known male reproductive toxicants, which creates a concern for human health. Testicular toxicity of phthalates is complex, involving both anti-androgenic effects and impairment of testis morphogenesis. Effects on testis morphogenesis are more difficult and time-consuming to quantify than anti-androgenic effects, and as a result are not factored into risk assessment for phthalates. To address this problem, we sought to develop a method for automatic identification of multinucleated germ cells (MNGs), a marker of phthalate toxicity, in digital images of fetal rat histological sections."

    abstract: "Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have provided compelling genetic associations for human complex traits and diseases, contributing to therapeutic target discovery and disease risk prediction. Unfortunately, associations discovered by current GWA methods only explain a modest proportion of the estimated heritability of these traits. Non-linear genetic effects have been proposed as a key contributor to this missing heritability problem."

    abstract: "Natural Language Processing (NLP) concerns the interactions between computers and human languages. Natural languages contain huge amounts of information, from the topics we talk/write about and our tone to the words we choose and their context. Because of their complexity, volume, and unstructured format, text data are messy and tricky to manipulate. This Python tutorial walks through basic steps in text processing. We will work with a sample corpus of documents and prepare it for downstream NLP tasks such as document classification and topic modeling. Topics covered include: text cleaning and normalization, stemming and lemmatization, bag of words, and n-grams."

    speaker: Joselyn Wallace
    title_affiliation: Genomics Data Scientist, CCV
    abstract: "Over the last 18 years, the approximate total cost of sequencing a genome has dropped from $100,000,000 to $1,000, leading to a dramatic growth of the field of genomics and its many other 'omics sequencing offshoots. The increased access to large amounts of sequencing data has created a new set of challenges around best practices for storage, management, and sharing of data. Here, we present RefChef -- a reference sequence management system to record the provenance of reference sequences, indices, annotations, and their associated metadata. RefChef uses a master yaml file to store references' metadata and the commands to download and process them, while Git (and optionally GitHub) version control is used to track changes to the master yaml file as new references are added. RefChef also allows users to view summary tables of available references, which can be viewed either inside the command line or can be hosted on an external website easily accessible to collaborators. RefChef helps researchers adhere to data management plans, makes research more reproducible, and saves valuable time and space on computing resources by facilitating the maintenance of clearly documented, communal reference sequences for research groups."
