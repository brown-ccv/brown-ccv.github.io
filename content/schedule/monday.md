    abstract: "Over the last 18 years, the approximate total cost of sequencing a genome has dropped from $100,000,000 to $1,000, leading to a dramatic growth of the field of genomics and its many other 'omics sequencing offshoots. The increased access to large amounts of sequencing data has created a new set of challenges around best practices for storage, management, and sharing of data. Here, we present RefChef -- a reference sequence management system to record the provenance of reference sequences, indices, annotations, and their associated metadata. RefChef uses a master yaml file to store references' metadata and the commands to download and process them, while Git (and optionally GitHub) version control is used to track changes to the master yaml file as new references are added. RefChef also allows users to view summary tables of available references, which can be viewed either inside the command line or can be hosted on an external website easily accessible to collaborators. RefChef helps researchers adhere to data management plans, makes research more reproducible, and saves valuable time and space on computing resources by facilitating the maintenance of clearly documented, communal reference sequences for research groups."

  - title: "Lightning Talk: Quantifying OCD-related behaviors via behavioral tasks in JavaScript"

    abstract: Quantification of behaviors related to neuropsychiatric disorders presents a challenge for researchers; symptoms are not homogenous across individuals with the same diagnosis and symptoms wax and wane over time. Psychophysical tasks provide a controlled setting to probe various behavioral and cognitive states, including reward evaluation, uncertainty, and error-monitoring. However, psychophysical tasks are typically deployed in the lab or the clinic, making it difficult for repeated testing over time. We have developed a code base for deploying behavioral tasks across various platforms (e.g. in clinic, at home, online) to study how OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) related behaviors change over time and vary across individuals.
