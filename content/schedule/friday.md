  abstract: The unique traits of each organism stem from the combined effects of gene interactions during development in a particular sequence of environments. Just as a change in environment can alter the expression of individual genes, a mutation in one gene can alter the expression of other genes. We will explore this complex web of interactions using genomic analyses of <i>Drosophila</i> in different genetic and environmental contexts.
