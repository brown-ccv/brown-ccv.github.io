    abstract: Physical phenomena such as fluid flow, wave propagation, heat flow, quantum-mechanical system etc. are defined by partial differential equations (PDEs). To simulate these phenomena its essential to solve these  PDEs using numerical discretization. Numerical discretization is very complex and suffers the curse of dimensionality and meshes. Thanks to Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN) for circumventing these problems. In this work, we show the efficiency of data parallel model, implemented over GPUs, to overcome the computational complexity of PINN models.
