    abstract: The talk will give a short overview about VR and the devices used at CCV, as well as how these can be used and how CCV can support and assist faculty to visualize and interact with their data in an immersive way to solve their research questions.
  - title: Developing Virtual Reality Visualizations for Exploring Dinosaur Footprint Formation
    time:
      start: 4:45
      end: 5:00
    speaker: Morgan L. Turner
    title_affiliation: Graduate Student
    abstract: "We have developed Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations based on guineafowl X-ray Reconstruction of Moving Morphology (XROMM) data and CT scans of Early Jurassic fossil dinosaur tracks. Foot motion data serve as inputs for dynamic DEM substrate simulations made up of millions of particles. To explore the dense volumes of 3D data generated from these methods, we turned to an immersive virtual reality (VR) room, Brown’s Yurt Ultimate Reality Theater (YURT). This talk will highlight the process of developing interactive visualizations that allow us to synthesize substrate flow at the particle, particle cluster, surface, and volumetric scale. "
